sentence=Send magic-sequence-wrapped data (ex. from serial comm)
paragraph=Tiny low-overhead library, coupled with MagicSerialDechunk, for inter-device communications.  The initial version uses magic sequences before and after a user-provided length of data (a chunk).  It presently doesn't do a checksum nor variable length.  If your data contains those magic sequences it'll screw up since there's no "escaping".
